                Daisy Johnson is a superhero with seismic (earthquake-producing) powers. She has the ability to generate powerful shockwaves and vibrations, which she can use both offensively and defensively. In the Marvel Comics, she is often associated with the superhero team known as the Avengers and the intelligence organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division). In the comics, Daisy has played various roles, including being a member of the Secret Warriors, a team of superhumans assembled by Nick Fury to combat threats to the world.

                Vibration Manipulation: All existing matter and energy within the known universe vibrate at a specific resonant frequency on the quantum level. Forced into a state of Terrigenesis via her exposure to the Diviner's extraterrestrial contents, Daisy Johnson acquired the ability to sense the various frequency vibrations in her environment and manipulate them. Her powers are connected to her heart rate, and as a negative result she can lose control of her powers whenever her heartbeat increases during stressful situations.            </p>
